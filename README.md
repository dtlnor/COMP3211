# COMP3211
Debugger

Implement two or more debugging tools (aka software fault localization tools), e.g. Tarantula [jones05] (see Homework 1) and Crosstab [wong08] (see Homework 2), and try to debug a program (e.g. a sorting program) or several programs of yours. Write a report to compare the performance of different debugging tools. For example, their accuracy, recall, etc. on different types of programs.

Evaluation method:
  1. By the end of the semester, each group will be given 8 minutes (and 2 additional minutes of Q&A) to present their work (using power point, demo, and (if necessary) other means).
  2. Job division must be clarified in the presentation. The group membersâ€™ grading may differ based on the job division.
  3. Grades will be based on the comprehensiveness, difficulty, and novelty of implemented software fault localization tools; comprehensiveness of the test set (bug set, buggy program set); quality of the experiment results and comparisons; and quality of the presentation.
  4. The grading is mainly based on the presentation. Word version of the final report shall be submitted during the exam week (deadline to be declared), and is only auxiliary to the grading.
